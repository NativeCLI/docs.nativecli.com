# Starter Kits

NativeCLI provides starter kits for NativePHP. These kits are designed to help you get started with your project quickly. Each kit is designed to provide a base for your project, with the necessary files and configurations to get you started.

## How to use a Starter Kit

To use a starter kit, you simply invoke the new command with the `--using` flag and specify the kit you want to use.

For example, to create a new project using the NativeCLI `flux` starter kit, you would run:

```shell
nativecli new myproject --using=nativecli/desktop-starter-flux
```
